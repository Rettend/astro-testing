Hi again! I'm back with my second blog post. I've been busy learning Astro, and I've made a lot of progress.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Learning Astro**: I've been working through the Astro tutorial, and I've learned a lot about how Astro works.
2. **Making Pages**: I've made a few more pages.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my second blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
